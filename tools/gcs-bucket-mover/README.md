# GCS Bucket Mover Tool

Currently there is no built in way to move a GCS bucket and all objects from one project to another. The manual process is:
1. Note down all settings related to the source bucket
1. Create a temporary bucket in the target project
1. Create a Storage Transfer Service (STS) job to move all objects from the source bucket to the temporary bucket
1. Delete the source bucket
1. Immediately re-create the bucket in the target project
1. Create an STS job to move all objects from the temporary bucket to the new source bucket in the target project
1. Delete the temporary bucket
1. Re-apply all bucket settings from the source bucket

This tool is designed to automatically perform these steps to make a bucket move as seamless as possible.

## Limitations

* **NO** object level settings are handled with this tool. The Storage Transfer Service does the object copying, so only settings it copies are supported.
* Any website settings for a bucket are not copied. These must be manually noted before running the tool as the source bucket will be deleted.
* Object Change Notification settings for a bucket are not copied.
* Custom IAM roles cannot be copied across projects due to security reasons, so if the source bucket has one applied to it and the user has chosen to copy over IAM policies, the tool will throw an error.
* IAM policies at the source project level or higher that affect source bucket access will not be copied to the target project.

## Bucket Settings That Are Copied

The tool will attempt to copy all of the following settings from the source bucket to the target bucket:
* **Storage Class** - The target bucket will have the same storage class
* **Location** - The target bucket will have the same location
* **IAM Policies** - All roles/members are copied (custom roles are not supported)
* **ACL Entities** - All bucket level ACL entities are copied
* **Default Object ACL** - If a bucket has default ACLs for objects, these entities are copied
* **Requester Pays** - This setting is copied, although it can cause issues if requests are then made without a user project specified
* **CORS** - All CORS settings are copied
* **Default KMS Key** - If the bucket contains a custom cloud KMS key, **it is assumed this key is in the source project** and the tool will attempt to give the target project service account Encrypter/Decrypter permissions to that key
* **Labels** - All labels are copied
* **Lifecycle Rules** - All lifecycle rules are copied
* **Logging** - Bucket logging is copied
* **Versioning** - This setting is copied
* **Notifications** - Any Cloud Pub/Sub notifications are copied along with assigning the required permissions for the target project

Individual settings can be ignored by adding the associated command line option. Alternatively the -se (--skipEverything) option can be passed so no settings other than storage class and location are copied.

## Credentials

The `confg.sh` file contains two environment variables that must be set with project credentials in order for the tool to run. The script can then be sourced (`. ./config.sh`) to set them before the bucket mover is run.
```
GCP_SOURCE_PROJECT_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY   The location on disk for service account key json file from the source project
GCP_TARGET_PROJECT_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY   The location on disk for service account key json file from the target project
```

The source project service account requires permissions to list and delete the source bucket, as well as able to assign IAM permissions to the bucket so the STS job can read and delete objects from it.
It may also require permission to be able to assign IAM permissions for the target project service account to access a KMS key and Cloud Pub/Sub topic.

The target project service account requires **Editor** or **Owner** in order to create the STS job, as well as permission to create/delete buckets.

## Basic Usage

```
usage: bucket_mover [-h] [--test] [--tempBucketName TEMPBUCKETNAME]
                    [--location LOCATION]
                    [--storageClass {MULTI_REGIONAL,NAM4,REGIONAL,STANDARD,NEARLINE,COLDLINE,DURABLE_REDUCED_AVAILABILITY}]
                    [--skipEverything] [--skipAcl] [--skipCors]
                    [--skipDefaultObjectAcl] [--skipIam] [--skipKmsKey]
                    [--skipLabels] [--skipLogging] [--skipLifecycleRules]
                    [--skipNotifications] [--skipRequesterPays]
                    [--skipVersioning]
                    bucket_name source_project target_project

Moves a GCS bucket from one project to another, along with all objects and optionally copying all other bucket settings.

positional arguments:
  bucket_name           The name of the bucket to be moved.
  source_project        The project id that the bucket is currently in.
  target_project        The project id that the bucket will be moved to.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --test                This will run a test of the tool to ensure all permissions are set up correctly and
                        buckets can be moved between the two projects, using a randomly generated bucket.
                        A fake bucket name will still need to be specified.
  --tempBucketName TEMPBUCKETNAME
                        The termporary bucket name to use in the target project.
  --location LOCATION   Specify a different location for the target bucket.
  --storageClass {MULTI_REGIONAL,NAM4,REGIONAL,STANDARD,NEARLINE,COLDLINE,DURABLE_REDUCED_AVAILABILITY}
                        Specify a different storage class for the target bucket.
  --skipEverything      Only copies the bucket's storage class and location. Equivalent to setting every other --skip parameter to True.
  --skipAcl             Don't replicate the ACLs from the source bucket.
  --skipCors            Don't copy the CORS settings from the source bucket.
  --skipDefaultObjectAcl
                        Don't copy the Default Object ACL from the source bucket.
  --skipIam             Don't replicate the IAM policies from the source bucket.
  --skipKmsKey          Don't copy the Default KMS Key from the source bucket.
  --skipLabels          Don't copy the Labels from the source bucket.
  --skipLogging         Don't copy the Logging settings from the source bucket.
  --skipLifecycleRules  Don't copy the Lifecycle Rules from the source bucket.
  --skipNotifications   Don't copy the Cloud Pub/Sub notification setting from the source bucket.
  --skipRequesterPays   Don't copy the Requester Pays setting from the source bucket.
  --skipVersioning      Don't copy the Versioning setting from the source bucket.
```

## Test Run

It is **highly recommended** that a test run is performed before attempting to move an important bucket.
By adding the --test flag, the tool will create a random bucket along with setting up lots of options for the bucket, upload some files to it and then move it to the target project. After it is complete, you can verify in the target project that the bucket and all settings were moved correctly.

Service account access permissions are the trickiest part of this tool, so this allows you to confirm they are all set up correctly before running it on an important bucket.
There are several global variables at the top of the gcs_bucket_mover_test.py file that will need to be configured for your environment.
Bucket settings can be removed/added/changed in the bucket_mover_tester.py code (ie Lifecycle Rules, Notifications or custom KMS keys).

### Examples

**Test run to confirm tool has access (where a test bucket already exists from a previous test)**

`bin/bucket_mover --test fake_bucket my_source_project my_target_project`

```

**Change the storage class and/or location of a bucket (without moving projects)**

Make sure `config.sh` has both environment variables set with the credentials for the project you're working in.

`bin/bucket_mover my_bucket my_project my_project --location eu --storageClass MULTI_REGIONAL`

## Bucket and Object Permissions

If skip command line options are not specified, the tool will copy over all bucket level IAM roles, ACLs and default object ACLs to the target bucket in the target project. The target bucket's permissions will all be overwritten, so if the target project has custom default bucket ACLs, they will be replaced.

IAM policies at the source project level or higher that affect source bucket access will not be copied to the target project. Custom IAM roles are not supported, the tool will throw an error if the source bucket has any custom roles attached to it.
There may be existing project level policies in the target project that could affect the access level of the target bucket.
